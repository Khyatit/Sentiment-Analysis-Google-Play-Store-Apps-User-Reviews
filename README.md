# Sentiment-Analysis-Google-Play-Store-Apps-User-Reviews
A comprehensive analysis of the Android app market by comparing over ten thousand apps in Google Play across different categories. Found insights in the data to devise strategies to drive growth and retention.

## üõ†Ô∏è Description
This project I have applied the skills from Joining Data with pandas. This project also uses the plotting libraries Seaborn and Plotly to help visualize the results of some steps. 

The data for this project was scraped from the Google Play website. While there are many popular datasets for Apple App Store, there aren't many for Google Play apps, which is partially due to the increased difficulty in scraping the latter as compared to the former.
